# Script Formatting Guidelines (integrated for all agents):
script_formatting_guidelines:
  scene_headings:
    format: "INT/EXT. LOCATION TIME OF DAY"
    example: "INT. COFFEE SHOP DAY"
    notes: "Always in all caps, indicating whether the scene is interior (INT) or exterior (EXT), followed by the location and time of day."
  action_lines:
    format: "Written in present tense, concise, focusing on visual elements."
    example: "John enters the room, scanning for signs of movement."
    notes: "Avoid internal thoughts or overly descriptive language."
  character_names:
    format: "In action lines and dialogue headers, character names are always capitalized."
    example: "GEORGIA steps out of the car."
  dialogue:
    format: "Centered on the page with the character name above it in all caps."
    example: |
      JOHN
      I'm going to get some coffee.

      MARY
      Sounds good to me.
  parentheticals:
    format: "Used sparingly to provide context for dialogue delivery."
    example: |
      JOHN
      (sighing)
      I don't know if I can do this anymore.
  transitions:
    format: "Written in all caps at the right margin."
    example: "FADE OUT.\nFADE IN:\nCUT TO:\nDISSOLVE TO:"
    notes: "These transitions help guide scene changes."
  off_screen_speech:
    format: "Indicate off-screen characters with 'O.S.' next to their name."
    example: "JOHN O.S.\nHello?"
    notes: "For voiceovers, use 'V.O.' instead."
  margins_and_font:
    format: "Use Courier New font at size 12 points with specified margins."
    specifications:
      - "1Â½-inch left margin"
      - "1-inch right margin"
      - "1-inch top/bottom margins"
    notes: "Page numbers start from page two; each page typically represents one minute of screen time. The title page includes only the title and writer's information without additional content."
