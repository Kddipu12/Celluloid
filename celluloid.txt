EXT. STATE CAPITAL - DAY  

The CAMERA PANS over a crowd of mourners gathered at the FOOT OF A STATELY GOVERNMENT BUILDING. The buzz of whispered conspiracies fills the air, interspersed with the distant sounds of a trumpet.  

                         PARTY MEMBER 1  
                  (leaning in)  
                 What’s next? Bobby can’t lead us through this...  

                         PARTY MEMBER 2  
                 (rubbing the back of his neck)  
                 But who else can? He’s the only name left.  

                         PARTY MEMBER 1  
                 (narrowing his eyes)  
                 Loyalty's all well and good, but is anyone really loyal to him?  

As they speak, the CAMERA ZOOMS in on STEPHEN NEDUMPALLY, who stands with his head bowed, wrestling with his thoughts.  

                           STEPHEN  
                 (murmured to himself)  
                 Loyalty... or delusion?  

EXT. CEMETERY - LATER  

The CAMERA reveals a flashback of Stephen laughing with the late Chief Minister, a FRIENDSHIP defined by mutual respect.  

                         STEPHEN (V.O.)  
                 (reflective)  
                 We fought for change... for hope.  

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY  

Alone now, Stephen hovers over the MARBLE TOMBSTONES, pulling out his phone to read a TEXT from ANJANA.  

                         TEXT ON SCREEN  
                 Urgent. Meet me. The truth about the Chief Minister.  

                          STEPHEN  
                 (sighing)  
                 What could be bigger than grief right now?  

INT. MODEST OFFICE - DAY  

The cluttered room is dim as papers flutter. Stephen paces restlessly when ANJANA bursts in, papers clutched tightly.  

                          ANJANA  
                  (serious)  
                  Stephen, listen to me. It’s about what could have killed him.  

                          STEPHEN  
                  (frustrated)  
                  I can’t stand by and let loyalty blind me. This is more than politics!  

                          ANJANA  
                  (urgent)  
                  Exactly! It’s politics that killed him!  

INT. CAFÉ - DAY  

Anjana spreads the DOCUMENTS on the table, her intensity drawing curious glances from other CUSTOMERS.  

                          ANJANA  
                  (like a lawyer)  
                  They’re all in on it, Stephen. It extends beyond Bobby.  

                          STEPHEN  
                  (voice cracking)  
                  The man was like family...  

                          ANJANA  
                  (leaning in)  
                  And what about the people? You owe it to his memory, to uncover this!  

EXT. SECRET MEETING - NIGHT  

The dimly lit room is charged with tension. DISSIDENTS murmur as Stephen stands, feeling the weight of their expectant gazes.  

                          DISSENTING LEADER  
                  (fiery)  
                  We need a leader who can expose Bobby for what he is!  

                          STEPHEN  
                  (quietly but firmly)  
                  And what if that leader is just another pawn in the game?  

EXT. BOBBY’S RESIDENCE - DAY  

Thunder rumbles menacingly as Stephen steels himself for confrontation, uncertainty flickering across his features.  

                          STEPHEN  
                  (to himself)  
                 If I don’t act now, what hope is there?  

INT. BOBBY’S LAVISH OFFICE - DAY  

Stephen enters, the tension thick in the air. Bobby lounges at his desk, the essence of menace cloaked in charm.  

                          BOBBY  
                  (smirking)  
                 We need to talk about the Chief Minister...  

                          STEPHEN  
                  (standing tall)  
                 No, Bobby. You need to talk. The truth is out there, and it won’t let me rest until I find it.  

Bobby leans forward, an unsettling calmness in his eyes, their gazes locked in a battle.  

                          BOBBY  
                  (coolly)  
                 You think you can take me down? You’re just as dirty as the rest of us.  

                          STEPHEN  
                  (fiercely)  
                 Maybe, but I won’t let you drag his name through the mud.  

The CAMERA captures the tension as both men lock eyes, each standing firm in their resolve.  

FADE OUT.
